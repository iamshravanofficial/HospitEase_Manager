# hosp_management_using_cpp_linkedlist

  Hospital Management System implemented using a linked list data structure. The system allows for the management of patient records within a hospital. Patients are represented as objects of the Patient class, and their records are organized using a linked list in the Patient_Record class.

Admit First Patient: A function is provided to admit the first patient in the linked list.
Remove First Patient: The system supports removing the first patient from the linked list.
